the 12 uniselectors (hereafter: unis) are switches that you toggle between 1 and 0 in order to enter instructions
the load button loads the current set of 12 uniselector bits
the potatOS key functions as a shift key to be used for certain instructions

first four unis are instruction bits

second four are usually the first register location (in binary)

second four are usually the first register location (in binary)

current supported instructions:
0000 = add 1st reg to 2nd reg, store in 2nd
0000 + SHIFT makes 1st reg slot just input a number (up to 15), adds it to 2nd reg

0001 = subtract 1st reg from 2nd reg, store in 2nd
0000 + SHIFT makes 1st reg slot just input a number (up to 15), subtracts it from 2nd reg

0010 = multiply 1st reg from 2nd reg, store in 2nd
0000 + SHIFT makes 1st reg slot just input a number (up to 15), mult it by 2nd reg

0011 = clear either two regs(if diff regs entered) or just one reg(by entering the same reg twice)

0100 = flip sign of either two regs(if diff regs entered) or just one reg(by entering the same reg twice)

0101 = move reg1 into reg2
0101 + SHIFT makes 1st reg slot just input a number (up to 15), moves it into 2nd reg

0110 // nothing yet

0111 = jump, nowhere close to finished yet

1000 // nothing yet

1001 = prints the ascii equivalent of the value of 1st reg, the number of times specified by the raw number of 2nd reg slot (up to 15)
.
.//nothing yet lol
.
.
1111 = makes all 8 unis after the first 4 function to input a number (up to 255) into reg0
